# Which parts of the assignment did you complete? Mark them 'done'.
# You can also mark non-completed parts as 'attempted' if you spent a fair amount of
# effort on them. If you do, explain the work you did in the problems/bugs section
# and leave your 'attempt' code in place (commented out if necessary) so we can see it.

R1 Integrate your raytracer (1p): done
       R2 Spotlight shading (1p): done
          R3 Shadow mapping (3p): done
       R4 Instant radiosity (5p): done
